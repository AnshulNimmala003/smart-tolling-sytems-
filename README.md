Smart Tolling System Using Machine Learning 

Objective:

The Smart Tolling System leverages Machine Learning (ML), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and AI-powered fraud detection to automate toll collection, improve efficiency, and reduce revenue leakage in toll systems. The project aims to eliminate manual intervention, minimize traffic congestion, and enhance security by detecting fraudulent activities.

Key Features
	1.	Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR):
	‚Ä¢	Uses OCR and computer vision to detect and extract vehicle number plates.
	‚Ä¢	Cross-checks the extracted plate with a vehicle database.
	2.	Vehicle Classification & Toll Calculation:
	‚Ä¢	ML models classify vehicles based on size, weight, and type (e.g., car, truck, bike).
	‚Ä¢	Dynamically calculates toll charges based on predefined rules.
	3.	Fraud Detection & Security Measures:
	‚Ä¢	Identifies stolen, blacklisted, or unpaid vehicles.
	‚Ä¢	Flags fraudulent behavior using anomaly detection algorithms.
	4.	Automated Toll Payment:
	‚Ä¢	Integrates RFID for quick transactions.
	‚Ä¢	Supports wallet-based digital payments for seamless toll collection.
	5.	Real-time Monitoring & Alerts:
	‚Ä¢	A web dashboard provides live toll operations insights.
	‚Ä¢	Sends notifications for violations, fraud, or unauthorized access.

Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	Machine Learning: Vehicle classification, fraud detection
	‚Ä¢	Computer Vision: OCR-based number plate recognition
	‚Ä¢	Database: SQL/NoSQL for vehicle records
	‚Ä¢	Web Interface: Flask/Django for monitoring & reports
	‚Ä¢	RFID Integration: For seamless vehicle detection

Expected Outcomes
	‚Ä¢	Reduced Traffic Congestion: Faster toll processing minimizes wait times.
	‚Ä¢	Improved Revenue Collection: Eliminates human error and fraud.
	‚Ä¢	Enhanced Security: Detects anomalies and unauthorized vehicles.
	‚Ä¢	Scalability: Can be extended to multiple toll booths with cloud-based infrastructure.
